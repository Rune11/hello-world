My first repository (yaaaay! \o/)

Hello!

The tutorial thingy told me to do this, so I'm here writing about myself :D
Well, what should I say? I'm a unuversity student, learning IT. I'm interested in game development mainly, but I like to do other stuff, which I find interesting or challenging (for example I find reverse engineering really interesting, I'm pretyy noob at it atm, but trying my best to improve... Sadly nowadays don't really have the time for it because of university stuff :( )
